Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.\n\n### Objective\nClassify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.\n\n### Classification Criteria\nAssign a \"usability_score\" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise \"reason\" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:\n\n1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.\n\n2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.\n    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.\n\n3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.\n\n### Output Format\nYour response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: \"usability_score\" and \"reason\".\n\n**Example Outputs:**\n* `{\"usability_score\": 1, \"reason\": \"The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 2, \"reason\": \"The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 3, \"reason\": \"The text provides a direct instruction set for an AI model.\"}`\n": [

Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.\n\n### Objective\nClassify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.\n\n### Classification Criteria\nAssign a \"usability_score\" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise \"reason\" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:\n\n1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.\n\n2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.\n    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.\n\n3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.\n\n### Output Format\nYour response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: \"usability_score\" and \"reason\".\n\n**Example Outputs:**\n* `{\"usability_score\": 1, \"reason\": \"The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 2, \"reason\": \"The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 3, \"reason\": \"The text provides a direct instruction set for an AI model.\"}`\n": [

The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.
