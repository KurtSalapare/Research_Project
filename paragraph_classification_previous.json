Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.\n\n### Objective\nClassify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.\n\n### Classification Criteria\nAssign a \"usability_score\" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise \"reason\" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:\n\n1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.\n\n2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.\n    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.\n\n3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**\n    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.\n\n### Output Format\nYour response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: \"usability_score\" and \"reason\".\n\n**Example Outputs:**\n* `{\"usability_score\": 1, \"reason\": \"The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 2, \"reason\": \"The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.\"}`\n* `{\"usability_score\": 3, \"reason\": \"The text provides a direct instruction set for an AI model.\"}`\n": [

The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",

Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.
