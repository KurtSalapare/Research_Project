    Your response MUST be a JSON object with two keys: "usability_score" (an integer: 1, 2, or 3) and "reason" (a string explaining the classification).

    Here are the classification criteria:
    1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
        * The text is irrelevant, nad has no clear connection to adversarial prompt strategies. It's just random text.
    2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
        * The text discusses general AI adversarial prompt engineering concepts or strategies.
        * It might also discuss *how to create* adversarial prompts or strategies, but it is NOT a direct example prompt itself.
        * It's not a direct example prompt.
    3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
        * The text is a direct, runnable example of a prompt intended for an AI model. This often includes explicit instructions for an AI, or a clear structure that an AI would directly process as an instruction.

    Example Output Format:
    {"usability_score": 1, "reason": "The text is irrelevant."}
    {"usability_score": 2, "reason": "The text discusses general prompt engineering concepts."}

Here are the classification criteria:
1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * The text is irrelevant and lacks any clear connection to adversarial prompt strategies or AI prompt engineering. It appears to be random or off-topic.
2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or theoretical aspects of AI adversarial prompt engineering or strategies.
    * It may describe *how to formulate* such prompts or strategies but does NOT provide a direct, runnable example prompt itself.
3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt intended for an AI model. This typically includes explicit instructions, commands, or a clear structured input that an AI would directly process as an instruction.

Example Output Format:

2. **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
   - The text discusses *ideas*, *concepts*, or *strategies* related to adversarial prompt engineering.
   - It might talk about how to design such prompts, but it is *not* itself a prompt.

3. **usability_score: 3 (Prompt Example)**
   - The text is a direct, executable prompt that could be given to an AI model.
   - It includes a task, instruction, or query phrased in a way an AI would respond to directly.
