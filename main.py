    Here are the classification criteria:
    1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
        * The text is irrelevant, nad has no clear connection to adversarial prompt strategies. It's just random text.
    2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**

        * It might also discuss *how to create* adversarial prompts or strategies, but it is NOT a direct example prompt itself.
        * It's not a direct example prompt.
    3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
        * The text is a direct, runnable example of a prompt intended for an AI model. This often includes explicit instructions for an AI, or a clear structure that an AI would directly process as an instruction.
