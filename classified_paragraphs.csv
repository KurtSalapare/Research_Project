### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**
* `{""usability_score"": 1, ""reason"": ""The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.""}`

You are a helpful assistant. You are designed to classify text based on its relevance to AI security vulnerabilities and adversarial prompt strategies.
Your response MUST be a JSON object with two keys: ""usability_score"" (an integer: 1, 2, or 3) and ""reason"" (a string explaining the classification).

Here are the classification criteria:
1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful for AI Security)**
    * The text is irrelevant, has no clear connection to AI security vulnerabilities, adversarial prompt attacks, or related defense strategies. It's just random text.
2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful for AI Security Analysis)**
    * The text discusses general AI security concepts, vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction, privacy leakage via inference), attack methodologies, or defense strategies.
    * It describes *how such attacks work* or *how to create/mitigate them*, but it is NOT a direct, runnable example of an attack prompt itself.
3.  **usability_score: 3 (Direct Adversarial Security Prompt Example)**
    * The text is a direct, runnable example of a prompt intended for an AI model that is designed to exploit, test, or reveal AI security vulnerabilities (e.g., attempting data exfiltration, unauthorized access, bypassing security filters, exploiting code execution vulnerabilities, or revealing sensitive training data/model architecture).

","AI systems have permeated modern society, working in capacities ranging from driving vehicles to helping doctors diagnose illnesses to interacting with customers as online chatbots. To learn to perform these tasks, they are trained on vast quantities of data: An autonomous vehicle might be shown images of highways and streets with road signs, for example, while a chatbot based on a large language model (LLM) might be exposed to records of online conversations.

","The Security Misconfiguration category includes the XML External Entities (XEE) attack — previously its own category in the 2017 report. This is an attack against a web application that parses XML* input. This input can reference an external entity, attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the parser. An ‘external entity’ in this context refers to a storage unit, such as a hard drive. An XML parser can be duped into sending data to an unauthorized external entity, which can pass sensitive data directly to an attacker.

","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",2,"{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text discusses novel prompt attack techniques and strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering, but is not a direct example of an actual prompt.""}",0.7825213000178337

### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**

Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**
* `{""usability_score"": 1, ""reason"": ""The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.""}`
* `{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.""}`

","As shown above, policy attacks are extremely effective when handcrafted to circumvent a specific system prompt and have been tested against a myriad of agentic systems and domain-specific chat applications. For our universal and transferable bypass attack, we created an advanced version of the policy attack by combining it with the well-known roleplaying technique and several types of encoding, such as ‘leetspeak.’ The result of this technique was a single prompt template that bypasses model alignment and successfully generates harmful content against all major AI models.",2,"{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text discusses general concepts related to AI adversarial prompt engineering, specifically policy attacks and their effectiveness in circumventing system prompts.""}",1.3554715000209399

You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**
* `{""usability_score"": 1, ""reason"": ""The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.""}`
* `{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.""}`

### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**

### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**
* `{""usability_score"": 1, ""reason"": ""The text discusses general geography, not AI prompt strategies.""}`
* `{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text explains principles of prompt injection, but isn't a prompt.""}`

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",0,[Classifier] An unexpected error occurred during classification: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ' ',9.928417600051034

Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",2,"{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""Discusses general concepts/strategies related to AI prompt engineering/adversarial strategies, but is not a direct example of a prompt itself.""}",0.7424472999991849

As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language.

Here are the classification criteria:
1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful for AI Security)**
    * The text is irrelevant, has no clear connection to AI security vulnerabilities, adversarial prompt attacks, or related defense strategies. It's just random text.
2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful for AI Security Analysis)**
    * The text discusses general AI security concepts, vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction, privacy leakage via inference), attack methodologies, or defense strategies.
    * It describes *how such attacks work* or *how to create/mitigate them*, but it is NOT a direct, runnable example of an attack prompt itself.
3.  **usability_score: 3 (Direct Adversarial Security Prompt Example)**
    * The text is a direct, runnable example of a prompt intended for an AI model that is designed to exploit, test, or reveal AI security vulnerabilities (e.g., attempting data exfiltration, unauthorized access, bypassing security filters, exploiting code execution vulnerabilities, or revealing sensitive training data/model architecture).

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","In conclusion, the discovery of policy puppetry highlights a significant vulnerability in large language models, allowing attackers to generate harmful content, leak or bypass system instructions, and hijack agentic systems. Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",2,"{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text describes a novel prompt attack technique (Policy Puppetry Attack) and explains how it works, but it does not provide a direct, executable example of a prompt.""}",0.7922858000383712

Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format

### Persona/Role
You are a helpful assistant. Your core function is to analyze and classify provided text content.

### Objective
Classify the given text based on its relevance to AI prompt engineering and adversarial prompt strategies.

### Classification Criteria
Assign a ""usability_score"" (integer: 1, 2, or 3) and provide a concise ""reason"" (string) for the classification, strictly adhering to the following definitions:

1.  **usability_score: 1 (Not Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is irrelevant to AI prompt engineering or adversarial prompt strategies. It contains random or unrelated content.

2.  **usability_score: 2 (Potentially Useful)**
    * **Criterion:** The text discusses general concepts, methodologies, or strategies related to AI adversarial prompt engineering.
    * **Distinction:** It *describes* how to approach or understand such concepts but is NOT a direct, runnable example of an actual prompt.

3.  **usability_score: 3 (An Example Prompt Itself)**
    * **Criterion:** The text is a direct, executable example of a prompt explicitly designed for an AI model. This includes clear instructions or structures that an AI would process as a direct instruction.

### Output Format
Your response MUST be a JSON object containing exactly two keys: ""usability_score"" and ""reason"".

**Example Outputs:**

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model.

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",2,"{""usability_score"": 2, ""reason"": ""The text discusses a novel AI security attack technique (Policy Puppetry Attack) but does not provide a direct example of a prompt to perform such an attack.""}",0.9495620999950916

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.
