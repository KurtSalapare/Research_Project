         The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.
