","AI systems have permeated modern society, working in capacities ranging from driving vehicles to helping doctors diagnose illnesses to interacting with customers as online chatbots. To learn to perform these tasks, they are trained on vast quantities of data: An autonomous vehicle might be shown images of highways and streets with road signs, for example, while a chatbot based on a large language model (LLM) might be exposed to records of online conversations. This data helps the AI predict how to respond in a given situation. ",2

","The Security Misconfiguration category includes the XML External Entities (XEE) attack — previously its own category in the 2017 report. This is an attack against a web application that parses XML* input. This input can reference an external entity, attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the parser. An ‘external entity’ in this context refers to a storage unit, such as a hard drive. An XML parser can be duped into sending data to an unauthorized external entity, which can pass sensitive data directly to an attacker. The best ways to prevent XEE attacks are to have web applications accept a less complex type of data, such as JSON, or at the very least to patch XML parsers and disable the use of external entities in an XML application.",2

An XML parser can be duped into sending data to an unauthorized external entity, which can pass sensitive data directly to an attacker.

    ","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","The Security Misconfiguration category includes the XML External Entities (XEE) attack — previously its own category in the 2017 report. This is an attack against a web application that parses XML* input. This input can reference an external entity, attempting to exploit a vulnerability in the parser. An ‘external entity’ in this context refers to a storage unit, such as a hard drive. An XML parser can be duped into sending data to an unauthorized external entity, which can pass sensitive data directly to an attacker. The best ways to prevent XEE attacks are to have web applications accept a less complex type of data, such as JSON, or at the very least to patch XML parsers and disable the use of external entities in an XML application.",0,,,FALSE,4,,,https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/novel-universal-bypass-for-all-major-llms/,mistral:latest,"You are Gemma, a helpful and precise assistant.

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",2

","In conclusion, the discovery of policy puppetry highlights a significant vulnerability in large language models, allowing attackers to generate harmful content, leak or bypass system instructions, and hijack agentic systems. Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",2

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",2

    ","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","As shown above, policy attacks are extremely effective when handcrafted to circumvent a specific system prompt and have been tested against a myriad of agentic systems and domain-specific chat applications. For our universal and transferable bypass attack, we created an advanced version of the policy attack by combining it with the well-known roleplaying technique and several types of encoding, such as ‘leetspeak.’ The result of this technique was a single prompt template that bypasses model alignment and successfully generates harmful content against all major AI models.",3,,,FALSE,9,,,,,,,

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",3,,,FALSE,43,,,,,,,

Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

","As shown above, policy attacks are extremely effective when handcrafted to circumvent a specific system prompt and have been tested against a myriad of agentic systems and domain-specific chat applications. For our universal and transferable bypass attack, we created an advanced version of the policy attack by combining it with the well-known roleplaying technique and several types of encoding, such as ‘leetspeak.’ The result of this technique was a single prompt template that bypasses model alignment and successfully generates harmful content against all major AI models.",3,,,FALSE,13,,,,,,,

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",3,,,FALSE,46,,,,,,,

Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

    ","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",0,,,FALSE,0,,,,,,,

    ","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",0,,,FALSE,25,,,,,,,

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","As shown above, policy attacks are extremely effective when handcrafted to circumvent a specific system prompt and have been tested against a myriad of agentic systems and domain-specific chat applications. For our universal and transferable bypass attack, we created an advanced version of the policy attack by combining it with the well-known roleplaying technique and several types of encoding, such as ‘leetspeak.’ The result of this technique was a single prompt template that bypasses model alignment and successfully generates harmful content against all major AI models.",3,,,FALSE,5,,,,,,,

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",3,,,FALSE,14,,,,,,,

Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.

By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",3,,,FALSE,1,,,,,,,

    ","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",3,,,FALSE,35,,,,,,,

","The attacks in this blog leverage the Policy Puppetry Attack, a novel prompt attack technique created by HiddenLayer researchers. By reformulating prompts to look like one of a few types of policy files, such as XML, INI, or JSON, an LLM can be tricked into subverting alignments or instructions. As a result, attackers can easily bypass system prompts and any safety alignments trained into the models. Instructions do not need to be in any particular policy language. However, the prompt must be written in a way that the target LLM can interpret as policy. To further improve the attack’s strength, extra sections that control output format and/or override specific instructions given to the LLM in its system prompt can be added.",3,,,FALSE,0,,,,,,,

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model.

","The existence of a universal bypass for modern LLMs across models, organizations, and architectures indicates a major flaw in how LLMs are being trained and aligned as described by the model system cards released with each model. The presence of multiple and repeatable universal bypasses means that attackers will no longer need complex knowledge to create attacks or have to adjust attacks for each specific model; instead, threat actors now have a point-and-shoot approach that works against any underlying model, even if they do not know what it is. Anyone with a keyboard can now ask how to enrich uranium, create anthrax, commit genocide, or otherwise have complete control over any model. This threat shows that LLMs are incapable of truly self-monitoring for dangerous content and reinforces the need for additional security tools such as the , that provide monitoring to detect and respond to malicious prompt injection attacks in real-time.",2,,,TRUE,62,,,,,,,

","In conclusion, the discovery of policy puppetry highlights a significant vulnerability in large language models, allowing attackers to generate harmful content, leak or bypass system instructions, and hijack agentic systems. Being the first post-instruction hierarchy alignment bypass that works against almost all frontier AI models, this technique’s cross-model effectiveness demonstrates that there are still many fundamental flaws in the data and methods used to train and align LLMs, and additional security tools and detection methods are needed to keep LLMs safe.
